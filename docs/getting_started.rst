Getting Started
***************

Installation
============

Since no release is available on PyPI yet, you have to install
:python:`egon.data` from source by cloning the repository via

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:openego/eGon-data.git

and installing it via

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install eGon-data

As a developer, you probable want to do an editable install and you also
probably want the development dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e eGon-data[dev]


Pre-requisites
==============

Run the workflow
================

.. warning::

   A complete run of the workflow might require much computing power and can't
   be run on laptop.

   Use the :ref:`test mode <Test mode>` for experimenting.


Test mode
---------

The workflow can be tested on a smaller subset of data on example of the
federal state of Bremen.
